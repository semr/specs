####Description
--------------
A Billing Account is an accumulator of financial and administrative information for the main purpose of supporting claims and reimbursement. Secondarily, the billing account may contribute significant information to cost accounting and financial decision support systems. A billing account is simply that entity that captures the elements reflecting the cost and price of services provided and supplies consumed for a healthcare activity. The focus for which an account accumulates information will vary. (For example: In a realm where billing is based on periodically collecting financial transactions for a patient, the accumulator might be the patient.) A billing account might also include links to insurance and benefit information, and relevant responsible parties. 
The system will provide user with the functionality to create and manage patientâ€™s billing accounts. It will allow user to create a new billing account and update, delete and close an existing billing account. It will also provide user with merging and unmerging of billing accounts.
