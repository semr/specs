####Description
--------------
The developed system will provide user with the facility to manage service delivery location (a place at which services may be provided). A service delivery location may be either an **incidental service delivery location** (a place at which services may be provided without prior designation or authorization) or a **dedicated service delivery location** (a place that is intended to house the provision of services). Dedicated service delivery locations can be further characterized as either clinical or non-clinical. A single physical place can play multiple service delivery location roles each with its own attributes. The functional requirements of this feature are categorized in three categories.

* **Notifications** state transitions of activated, revised, nullified and obsolete (duplicates
resolved).
* **Queries** for find locations, get details.
* **Requests** for adding and revising records.
