####Description
--------------
A Terminology Administrator will require exporting a terminology or terminology value set from the Terminology Server. This may require filtering of the exported content. In cases, where standard or common terminology interchange formats are available (such as HL7 Vocabulary MIF or LexGrid), conversion of content on the Terminology server into said standard would be considered.
